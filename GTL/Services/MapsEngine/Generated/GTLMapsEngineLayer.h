// A Layer combines multiple datasources, with styling information, for
// presentation on a map.

// box is expressed as \"west, south, east, north\". The numbers represent
// latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.

// The creation time of this layer. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time
// value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

// layerType is not specified and datasourceType is "image", then each element
// in this array is a reference to an Image or RasterCollection. If layerType is
// "vector", or layerType is not specified and datasourceType is "table" then
// each element in this array is a reference to a Vector Table.
@property (retain) NSArray *datasources;  // of GTLMapsEngineDatasource

// Deprecated: The type of the datasources used to build this Layer. Note: This

// Deprecated: The name of an access list of the Map Editor type. The user on
// whose behalf the request is being sent must be an editor on that access list.
// Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses access lists. Instead, each asset has
// its own list of permissions. For backward compatibility, the API still
// accepts access lists for projects that are already using access lists. If you
// created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to

// Deprecated: The access list to whom view permissions are granted. The value
// must be the name of a Maps Engine access list of the Map Viewer type, and the
// user must be a viewer on that list. Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses
// access lists. Instead, each asset has its own list of permissions. For
