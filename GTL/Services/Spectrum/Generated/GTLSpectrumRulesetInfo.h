// The regulatory domain to which the ruleset belongs is required. It must be a
// 2-letter country code. The device should use this to determine additional
// device behavior required by the associated regulatory domain.
@property (copy) NSString *authority;

// The maximum location change in meters is required in the initialization
// response, but optional otherwise. When the device changes location by more
// than this specified distance, it must contact the database to get the
// available spectrum for the new location. If the device is using spectrum that
// is no longer available, it must immediately cease use of the spectrum under
// rules for database-managed spectrum. If this value is provided within the
// context of an available-spectrum response, it takes precedence over the value
// within the initialization response.
@property (retain) NSNumber *maxLocationChange;  // doubleValue

// The maximum duration, in seconds, between requests for available spectrum. It
// is required in the initialization response, but optional otherwise. The
// device must contact the database to get available spectrum no less frequently
// than this duration. If the new spectrum information indicates that the device
// is using spectrum that is no longer available, it must immediately cease use
// of those frequencies under rules for database-managed spectrum. If this value
// is provided within the context of an available-spectrum response, it takes
// precedence over the value within the initialization response.
@property (retain) NSNumber *maxPollingSecs;  // intValue

// The identifiers of the rulesets supported for the device's location. The
// database should include at least one applicable ruleset in the initialization
// response. The device may use the ruleset identifiers to determine parameters
// to include in subsequent requests. Within the context of the
// available-spectrum responses, the database should include the identifier of
// the ruleset that it used to determine the available-spectrum response. If
// included, the device must use the specified ruleset to interpret the
// response. If the device does not support the indicated ruleset, it must not
// operate in the spectrum governed by the ruleset.
