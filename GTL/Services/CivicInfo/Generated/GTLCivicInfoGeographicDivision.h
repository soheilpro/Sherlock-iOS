// Any other valid OCD IDs that refer to the same division.
// Because OCD IDs are meant to be human-readable and at least somewhat
// predictable, there are occasionally several identifiers for a single
// division. These identifiers are defined to be equivalent to one another, and
// one is always indicated as the primary identifier. The primary identifier
// will be returned in ocd_id above, and any other equivalent valid identifiers
// will be returned in this list.
// For example, if this division's OCD ID is
// ocd-division/country:us/district:dc, this will contain
// ocd-division/country:us/state:dc.
